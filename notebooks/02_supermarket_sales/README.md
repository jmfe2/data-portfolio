# 🛒 Supermarket Sales – ETL and Data Validation Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using a real-world dataset of supermarket transactions. The goal is to extract sales data from a CSV file, transform and clean it using Python, and load it into a PostgreSQL database. We then validate the inserted data and prepare it for visualization in Power BI or other BI tools.

## 🚀 Highlights

- End-to-end ETL pipeline in Python  
- Data validation with SQLAlchemy  
- Clean export to CSV  
- Interactive dashboard built with Power BI  
- Version control and modular project structure

### 🔍 Insights

- Sales are relatively evenly distributed among the three cities: Yangon (33.8%), Mandalay (33.1%), and Naypyitaw (33.1%), with no dominant location.  
- Women generate a 5.3% higher average ticket than men (Female: \$322.99 vs. Male: \$306.63).  
- The most sold product line by quantity is **Electronic Accessories**, accounting for 19.2% of all units sold.  
- 61% of all sales occur between the 10th and 20th of each month, indicating a mid-month purchase pattern.

## 📄 Dataset Description

The dataset used is [`supermarket_sales.csv`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales), which contains:

- Invoice details
- Branch and city
- Customer type and gender
- Product line and quantity
- Pricing, VAT, payment method
- Date and time of transaction

📦 Rows: 1,000  
📊 Columns: 17

🧼 After ETL, the cleaned version is exported to:

`/data/02_supermarket_sales/cleaned_data/supermarket_cleaned.csv`

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI report built for this project includes insights such as:

- Total sales by city
- Revenue per product line
- Average transaction by gender
- Sales by payment method and day

🔗 The `.pbix` file is available in [`/figures/02_supermarket/powerbi_supermarket.pbix`](../figures/02_supermarket/powerbi_supermarket.pbix)

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Clone the repo and set up a Python virtual environment (optional):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jmfe2/data-portfolio.git
cd data-portfolio
```
   
2. Install libraries

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a .env file in the root directory with the following keys 

*Make sure your `.env` file is not tracked by Git. A `.env.example` is suggested for collaborators.*

```bash
DB_USER=your_username
DB_PASS=your_password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=your_database
```

## ⚙️ How to Run

After installing the requirements and setting up your `.env` file, you have two ways to run the ETL pipeline:

---

### 🧩 Option A – Manual via Python
  
  From the root of the repository, run:
  ```bash
  python -m scripts.02_supermarket.etl_pipeline
  ```
  Or open the notebooks:
  - 02_supermarket_postgresql.ipynb – Loads CSV into PostgreSQL
  - 03_validate_and_git.ipynb – Runs validation queries and tracks changes with Git 

### ⚙️ Option B – Run via Bash Script (macOS/Linux)

  1. Make the script executable (only once):
  ```bash
  chmod +x run_etl_supermarket.sh
  ```
  2. Then run the ETL pipeline:
  ```bash
  ./run_etl_supermarket.sh
  ```
  This script will:
  - Activate the virtual environment (.venv)
  - Load environment variables from .env
  - Run the full ETL process and log progress to /logs/etl_supermarket.log
  📌 Note: Make sure you're in the root directory (/data-portfolio) when running the script.

#### 4. Optional enhancements

- Mention log file location:

```md
ETL logs are written to: `/logs/etl_supermarket.log`
