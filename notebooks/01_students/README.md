# 🎓 Student Performance – EDA & Data Cleaning Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the academic performance of high school students based on gender, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation. The goal was to explore the dataset, clean and preprocess it, and generate visual insights using Python.

---

## 🔍 Insights

- **Gender**: Female students outperform males in reading and writing, while males slightly lead in math.
- **Parental education**: Higher parental education levels are correlated with better student performance.
- **Lunch type**: Students with standard lunch consistently score higher than those with free/reduced lunch.
- **Test preparation**: Students who completed a preparation course perform better across all subjects.
- **Race/ethnicity**: Some group differences are observed; Groups A and B tend to score lower on average.

## 💡 Recommendations

- **Parental engagement**: Promote home-learning strategies among parents with lower education levels.
- **Nutrition**: Improve lunch quality and access as a potential factor influencing academic performance.
- **Prep programs**: Expand access to test preparation courses to support struggling students.
