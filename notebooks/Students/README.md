### 📊 Project 01: Student Performance Exploration

### Description
This analysis explores the publicly available Students Performance dataset. The objective was to identify factors associated with academic performance in math, reading, and writing.

### 📌 Key Findings

Gender: Female students score higher in reading and writing, while male students perform slightly better in math.

Parental education level: Positively associated with higher scores across all subjects.

Lunch type: Students with standard lunch consistently outperform those with reduced-price lunch.

Test preparation course: Completing a prep course correlates with higher scores.

Race/ethnicity group: Subtle differences are observed; Groups A and B tend to have slightly lower average scores.

### 💡 Recommendations (Business Insights) 

Educational strategies: Implement academic reinforcement programs targeting underperforming groups.
